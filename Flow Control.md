### *while loop statement*
## *what*
You can make a block of code excute over and over again with a while statement.    
## *how*      
As long as the while statement's condition is True, the code in a while clause will be excuted.      
It's like a loop:at the end of a while clause, the program execution jumps back to the start of the while statement to check the condition.     
## *the format(what it consists of)*       
* The while keyword        
* A condition (an expression that evaluates to True or False)       
* A colon      
* Starting on the next line, an intented block of code(the while clause)
