# Python-Note
This note is based on a book named *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners*. It's a fantastic book for beginners. 
The note here will document my ideas and feelings inspired by this book. 
Considering there may be some codes in this notebook, I recommend the readers use JupyterLab or JupyterNote to read and interact with this note, in which way the pleasure can be gained to its most extent. 
Of course, all comments are welcome. Let's learn coding and change the world.
