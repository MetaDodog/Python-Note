# The style of code    
## The readability of code 
* when you want to rearrange long lines of code, use ```\``` at the end. It's a line continuation character.    
```
print('Oh such a perfect day ' + \ 
'Dodog is happy')
```


**expression** is the most basic kind of programming instruction in the language.     
It consists of **value** and **operator** and they can always **evaluate** down to a single value.     
>An *expression* will *evaluate* to a single *value*    
For example:
```
2+2    
#2+2 is called an expression, 2 is a value and + is an operator. The value the expression evauates to is 4, an integer value.
```        
  
  
# Method   
## What it is   
Each *data type* has its own set of *methods*  
It's kind of like a *function*  
## Format   
The *method* part comes after a *value*, seperated by a period  
for example:  
```   
>>>dodog = ['d', 'o', 'd', 'o', 'g']   
>>>dodog.index('d')      
0  #notice that when there are duplicates of the value, it will return the index of the first appearance   
```
